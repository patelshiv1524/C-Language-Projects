Project Description:- 

The Student Management System is a C++ program designed to manage student records. In addition to adding new student records, users can also edit current records, delete records from the system, and search for specific student information. To save and work with student data, the program makes use of file handling. 

Learning Outcomes :- 

1) Recognize Basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts: Through working with C++ classes and objects, students will acquire a firm grasp of basic OOP ideas like polymorphism, inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction.
2) Enhance File Handling Skills: Students will learn how to read from and write to binary files as well as conduct file operations in C++. This covers methods for entering, looking up, modifying, and removing records from a file.
3) Improve Input-Output Handling: Students will gain experience in efficiently managing user input and output, including how to ask for information, show messages, and control menu-based interactions.
4) Practice Menu-Driven Program Design: Students will create and put into place a menu-driven program structure that presents options to users and then triggers related actions in response to input from the user. This method improves their ability to manage program flow and create user-friendly interfaces.
5) Learn Error Handling Techniques: To ensure the program's robustness and dependability, learners will implement error handling mechanisms to handle unforeseen user inputs or file operations.
6) Examine Data Structure Design: Despite using a basic data structure for this project, students will learn how to create more intricate data structures in order to effectively represent and manage student records.
